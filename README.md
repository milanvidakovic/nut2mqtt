# nut2mqtt
Communication between Network UPS Tools (NUT) and MQTT

Uses [Network UPS Tools (NUT)](https://networkupstools.org/docs/developer-guide.chunked/ar01s08.html) library

Features:
* uses username/password, as created in /etc/nut/upsd.users, to login to the nut-server
* will enumerate all UPS instances maintained by the service
* will enumerate all available read-only variables, read-write variables, and commands for each instance
* on startup, will transmit all read-only variables as a JSON map to the specified MQTT topic
* on regular intervals, as specified in the nut2mqtt.cfg file, will transmit the variables designated as 'publish' as a JSON map to the specified MQTT topic
* the variables marked as 'numeric' in the nutqmqtt.cfg file will be transmited as numeric (rather than a string)
* on a broken connection to the MQTT server, a reconnections will be attempted (to be tested)

Packages to be installed (all platforms):
```
sudo apt install libnutclient-dev
sudo apt install libpaho-mqtt-dev
```

Packages (beaglebone) simply use the 'debian generic' section below, the other two sections are here as a reference:
```
# debian version 12.2 (not available yet)
sudo apt install libboost-filesystem1.81-dev
sudo apt install libboost-log1.81-dev
sudo apt install libboost-program-options1.81-dev
sudo apt install libboost-thread1.81-dev
# debian version 11.7 (as of 2023/10/08)
sudo apt install libboost-filesystem1.74-dev
sudo apt install libboost-log1.74-dev
sudo apt install libboost-program-options1.74-dev
sudo apt install libboost-thread1.74-dev
# debian generic
sudo apt install libboost-filesystem-dev
sudo apt install libboost-log-dev
sudo apt install libboost-program-options-dev
sudo apt install libboost-thread-dev
```

To Build statically linked application:
```
git clone https://github.com/rburkholder/nut2mqtt.git
cd nut2mqtt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
ln -s build/src/nut2mqtt nut2mqtt
# create & populate nut2mqtt.cfg with example
# then run:
./nut2mqtt
```

An example systemd control file can be found in systemd/nut2mqtt.service.  Change working directory & executable to suit.

Configuration File template (change usernames, passwords, and addresses):
```
$ cat x64/debug/nut2mqtt.cfg
nut_enumerate = true    # emit found variables & commands on first iteration
nut_host = localhost
nut_username = admin
nut_password = password
nut_poll_interval = 15

mqtt_id = nut1
mqtt_host = 127.0.0.1
mqtt_username = admin
mqtt_password = password
mqtt_topic = nut

```

```

From some user on the internet:  the poll interval in UPS.CONF controls the rate at which NUT queries the UPS, this is where I had my problem with my CyberPower units, the default value of 2 seconds caused my UPS to quit talking to NUT over the USB connection. I ended up with a value of 15 seconds and it has been solid for over a year of continuous operation. I did not try to tune it down to a smaller value, so I do not know what the minimum is for the CyberPower.
